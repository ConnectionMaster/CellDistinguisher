Description: Bulk tissue samples examined by gene expression studies
    are usually heterogeneous. The data gained from these samples
    display the confounding patterns of mixtures consisting of
    multiple cell types or similar cell types in various functional
    states, which hinders the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms
    underlying complex biological phenomena. A realistic approach to
    compensate for the limitations of experimentally separating
    homogenous cell populations from mixed tissues is to
    computationally identify cell-type specific patterns from bulk,
    heterogeneous measurements. We designed the CellDistinguisher
    algorithm to analyze the gene expression data of mixed samples,
    identifying genes that best distinguish biological processes and
    cell types.
